# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple single-page-application toy project to create a playable game with React (and CSS styling).

This was my second project in React, and the first where I wasn't following any type of guide/tutorial. As such, the division into components is very, very poor, and I don't make proper use of hooks. I would do a lot differently if I were to restart this project today.

### Play

On GitHub Pages at [https://kr-matthews.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://kr-matthews.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

### Game-play

There are two players playing against each other on a common interface (screen). Each player can be human-controlled or one of several built-in computer players.

Wins-ties-loses are tracked (until the page is refreshed or exited).
