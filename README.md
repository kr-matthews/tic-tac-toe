# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple SPA toy project to create a playable game with React (and reasonable CSS styling).

### Game-play (intentions -- project is incomplete)

You can have two players play against each other (on the same screen), or opt to play against the computer.
There are several computer players to choose from.

Wins-ties-loses are tracked (until the page is refreshed or exited).
